Carries need the most farm and usually play in the safe lane, focusing on last hitting and avoiding unnecessary fights until they get strong items. Heroes like Anti-Mage, Phantom Assassin, and Terrorblade fit this role.\r\n• Mid (Position 2): Plays solo in the middle lane and is responsible for controlling the tempo of the game. Mid heroes usually have strong spells or abilities that allow them to secure kills and rotate to other lanes. Examples include Storm Spirit, Lina, and Invoker.\r\n• Offlaner (Position 3): The tanky or utility hero that plays in the hard lane, contesting farm against the enemy carry. Offlaners focus on surviving the lane and initiating fights later in the game. Heroes like Tidehunter, Axe, and Centaur Warrunner excel in this role.","metadata":{"source":"roles.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":4}}}}],["08e36145-1a79-448e-a391-343b010c99ea",{"pageContent":"• Soft Support (Position 4): A roaming support who applies pressure, sets up kills, and provides vision with wards.
