The five primary roles in Dota 2 are:
• Carry (Position 1): The team’s main damage dealer in the late game. Carries need the most farm and usually play in the safe lane, focusing on last hitting and avoiding unnecessary fights until they get strong items. Heroes like Anti-Mage, Phantom Assassin, and Terrorblade fit this role.
• Mid (Position 2): Plays solo in the middle lane and is responsible for controlling the tempo of the game. Mid heroes usually have strong spells or abilities that allow them to secure kills and rotate to other lanes. Examples include Storm Spirit, Lina, and Invoker.
• Offlaner (Position 3): The tanky or utility hero that plays in the hard lane, contesting farm against the enemy carry. Offlaners focus on surviving the lane and initiating fights later in the game. Heroes like Tidehunter, Axe, and Centaur Warrunner excel in this role.
• Soft Support (Position 4): A roaming support who applies pressure, sets up kills, and provides vision with wards. Position 4 players move around the map helping teammates, using heroes like Earth Spirit, Tusk, or Mirana.
• Hard Support (Position 5): The team’s main support, responsible for buying wards, helping the carry in the early game, and setting up fights. Position 5 heroes don’t need much farm and focus on keeping the team alive. Examples include Crystal Maiden, Dazzle, and Witch Doctor.
